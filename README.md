**Problem : Design an ATM Machine - Low Level Design**

***

*_NOTE_*: we are focusing on the service layer

**_Expectation :_**

 - User will be able to dispense some cash out of the machine.
 - User can insert a card, put some details and if the details are valid cash will be given.
 - Consider that a bank might be having a lot of machine, so that the solution must be generic for all.
 - We don't neet to implement any Database or API's whatsoever.
